<h1>The Best Movies According to Harsh</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bhola</h3>
<p>It's Ajay Devgn's bewildering passion for creating that one perfect actioner & this is a step in the right direction.</p>
<h3>Drishyam 2</h3>
<p>7 years later, our smartest common man Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) has now leveled up in society, from being a cable operator to being a theatre owner who also decides what films to play for maximum profit after reviewing them. The family doesn't stay all happy as the Police re-enter their life and this time it's IG Tarun Ahlawat (Akshaye Khanna), a colleague of Meera Deshmukh (Tabu).</p>
<h3>Ram Setu</h3>
<p>This part of the review, this little part, is called 'script analysis', which is completely skipped by the makers of this film because dafuq they were smoking while penning this? (Especially, the second half). You get all about Abhishek Sharma's story in the trailer itself, and the film is not exactly what you'd imagine but way worse.</p>
